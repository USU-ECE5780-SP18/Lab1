Devin Gillespie and John Call
Lab 1 - ADA

We left all the files in the folder ready to just run either part 4, 5, or 6 with the command

./part#.exe

where # is either 4, 5, or 6.  If you want to delete everything but the ada body files, we compliled everything with

gnatmake part#.adb

where # is 4, 5, or 6.  Then run as instructed above.

Comments for functionality are provided in the ada body files themselves.
